# Easy Polls

A website for creating and answering polls, and viewing their results, with a simple signup and login (non-secure, made to showcase different functionalities).

Built with [React](https://react.dev/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and [MUI](https://mui.com/). Used [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for storing data and [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks) for displaying the results of polls as a pie chart.
